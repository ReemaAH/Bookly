# BooklyVersion
## Android mobile application 

### Bookly is a booking app that unifies reservation services. It provides three different account types: Admin, Organization (service provider) and User. The most distinguishing thing about Bookly that it gamifies the userâ€™s engagement by implementing a reward system which makes the whole experience addictive and fun. 

### The project won the 4th place in "SWE 444 Projects Showcase" that was held in King Saud University.
